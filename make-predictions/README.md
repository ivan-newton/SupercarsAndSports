Overview: 

My first real React project where you can explore the best supercars bands and sports. To navigate, click the button to switch between options and see corresponding images of cars and sports for each choice. 

How it Works:

The parent component (App.js) manages which car and sport is currently selected.
The child component (ChildComponent.js) displays the current car/sport and provides a button to change options.
Clicking "Change Option" calls a function that updates the selection.
The app automatically cycles through the list of cars and sports.

Running the Application:

1. You'll need Node.js and Git installed on your computer.
2. Download the Project: In your device terminal, enter: 
- git clone https://github.com/your-repo/react-supercars-sports.git
- cd react-supercars-sports
3. Install dependencies: Once instead the project folder, install necessary files by running:
-npm install 
4.Start the project by running the following command:
-npm start 
5.After running this command, the default browser will open the application at:
-http://localhost:3000
